In this section, we present an overview of Git and its important and major features. 

## A Brief History of Git 
Git originated from the Linux kernel, a very large open source project. For most of the life of its maintainence, changes to the kernel were passed as patches and archived files. At the end of the maintence (2002), the project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper. 

In 2005, Bitkeeper's free-of-charge status was revoked. This drove the Linux development community (and the Linux creator, Linus Torvalds) to develop a separate tool based on things they learned using BitKeeper. 

Goals of the New System: 
* Speed
* Simple design
* Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)
* Fully distributed
* Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)

With these goals in mind, Git was created in 2005.
